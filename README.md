This project holds a special place in my heart because it was the very first thing I built when I started learning web development. At that time, I had just dipped my toes into HTML and CSS, and I wanted to create something that felt real—something I could look at and say, "I made this."    

So, I decided to try recreating the layout of Netflix but with an anime twist. Yeah i know it’s not perfect, and it doesn’t stream anything (or do much dynamically), but it represents where I began: excited, curious, and eager to learn.   

Building this taught me so much about structuring a webpage, making it visually appealing, and understanding how even small details can bring a design to life. Sure, it’s basic, but it reminds me of how far I’ve come since those early days—and how much further I can go if I keep going. 

If you’re reading this, maybe you’re also starting your journey in coding or exploring something new. If so, I hope this little project inspires you to take that first step, no matter how small it feels. Every expert was once a beginner, and every big project started as something simple like this. 

Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to look at my work.
